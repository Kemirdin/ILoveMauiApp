.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a framework for building cross-platform applications that can run on multiple operating systems, including Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. It is an evolution of the Xamarin.Forms framework, designed to provide a unified and streamlined development experience for creating native user interfaces and sharing code across platforms.

With .NET MAUI, developers can write a single codebase using C# and XAML to create the user interface and business logic for their applications. The framework abstracts the platform-specific details, allowing developers to build apps that have a native look and feel on each platform.

Here are some key points about .NET MAUI:

Cross-Platform Development: .NET MAUI allows developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms, reducing development time and effort.

Native Performance: The applications built with .NET MAUI leverage native controls and APIs, delivering high performance and a native user experience on each platform.

XAML-based UI: Developers can use XAML, a markup language, to define the user interface of their applications. XAML provides a declarative way to describe the UI, making it easier to create and maintain.

Code Sharing: .NET MAUI promotes code sharing by allowing developers to write shared logic and UI code that can be reused across platforms. This reduces duplication and simplifies maintenance.

Extensibility: .NET MAUI is built on the extensible .NET ecosystem, allowing developers to leverage existing libraries and frameworks. They can also create custom controls and components to meet specific app requirements.

Platform-specific Customizations: While sharing code across platforms, .NET MAUI also allows developers to implement platform-specific customizations when needed. This flexibility enables fine-tuning the user experience for each platform.

Community and Ecosystem: .NET MAUI benefits from the existing vibrant .NET community and ecosystem, providing access to a wide range of tools, libraries, and resources.

Overall, .NET MAUI empowers developers to build cross-platform applications efficiently, leveraging the power of .NET and C#. It combines the advantages of code sharing with platform-specific customization, enabling the creation of native, performant, and visually appealing applications on multiple platforms.
